# Historical Development Documentation

This directory contains archived development logs and session notes from the futures roll analysis framework implementation.

## Contents

- **SESSION_LOG.md**: Development session logs from October 2024 work sessions
- **mismatch_fix.md**: Technical notes on fixing contract labeling mismatches

## Status

These documents represent **completed work** and are preserved for historical reference only. They have been superseded by:

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Official version history and release notes
- **Git commit history**: Detailed implementation timeline
- **AGENTS.md**: Current repository guidelines and architecture
- **presentation_docs/analysis_report.pdf**: Complete methodology documentation

## Rationale

Archived as part of codebase streamlining (November 2024) to reduce documentation overlap while preserving historical context in version control.
